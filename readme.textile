h1. Vimeo Advanced API PHP Library

This library is all set to go with version 2 of our API. Just create the object and call a method like this:

<pre>$vimeo = new phpVimeo('your consumer key', 'your consumer secret');
$videos = $vimeo->call('vimeo.videos.getUploaded', array('user_id' => 'brad'));</pre>

The <code>index.php</code> file included will show you how to get an access token so that you can query the API for private items. To take a look at an example of how to upload a file, check out <code>upload.php</code>.

h2. Support

If you come across any bugs, or have any suggestions, please post them in our "API Forum":http://www.vimeo.com/forum:API.

h2. oEmbed

We've added an independent library for our "oEmbed API":https://developer.vimeo.com/apis/oembed. Just create the object and call a method like before:

<pre>$embed = new VimeoEmbed;
$html = $embed->call('https://vimeo.com/7598473');</pre>

See <code>embed.php</code> for example usage.
